# Typing-speed-test
This Program is a Typing Speed Tester created using Python to measure how fast and how accurately a user can type a given sentence.  The program first shows a sample sentence that the user must type. When the user is ready, the program starts a timer and waits for the user to type the same sentence. After the user finishes typing, the timer stops.
