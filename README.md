# Typing-speed-test
This Program is a Typing Speed Tester created using Python to measure how fast and how accurately a user can type a given sentence.  The program first shows a sample sentence that the user must type. When the user is ready, the program starts a timer and waits for the user to type the same sentence. After the user finishes typing, the timer stops.

How It Works -
1.​The application follows a simple, linear console flow:
​2.The program displays a passage of text for the user to type.
3.​It starts a timer immediately after the user begins typing (or upon a dedicated start command).
​4.The user types the text directly into the console input area.
​5.Once the user is finished (e.g., by pressing Enter/Return or upon the timer running out), the program stops the timer.
​6.The final results (WPM, Accuracy, and Errors) are printed to the console.

The primary goal of this project was to successfully implement the core programming challenges: the timer mechanism, the WPM calculation, and the real-time text comparison logic. By focusing on the console, we ensured the foundational algorithms are robust and accurate.
